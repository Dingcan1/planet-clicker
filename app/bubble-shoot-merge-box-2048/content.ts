        value: "strategy-tips",
        question: "What are some effective strategies for Bubble Shoot Merge Box 2048?",
        answer: "Some effective strategies for Bubble Shoot Merge Box 2048 include: 1) Focus on merging lower-numbered bubbles first to clear space; 2) Try to create chain reactions where one merge triggers multiple subsequent merges; 3) Pay attention to the upcoming bubbles and plan your shots accordingly; 4) Keep the center of the board as clear as possible to maintain flexibility; 5) When the board gets crowded, prioritize creating space over going for higher numbers."
      },
      {
        value: "highest-number",
        question: "Is 2048 the highest number you can achieve in the game?",
        answer: "While reaching 2048 is the named objective of the game, you can actually continue merging beyond this number. After creating a 2048 bubble, you can merge two of them to create a 4096 bubble, then 8192, and so on. The game doesn't have a built-in limit to how high you can go, though reaching these ultra-high numbers becomes increasingly challenging as the board fills up with bubbles."
